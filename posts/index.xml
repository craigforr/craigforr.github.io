      <description>Profiles One of the first things I do when working interactively on a Linux system is customize a few key configuration files, one of which is .bash_aliases, so that I can work more comfortably and efficiently at the command line.
PowerShell has its own equivalent of .bashrc in which you can create your own functions, aliases, and shortcuts to make working with PowerShell as an interactive shell much easier. It&amp;rsquo;s known as a profile.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick PowerShell tip&amp;hellip;
TL;DR Have you ever wanted to get a list of running desktop applications in PowerShell? Maybe you want to see what you have open but would rather not fumble around with Task Manager?
Here&amp;rsquo;s a one-liner to do just that:
gps | ? { $_.MainWindowTitle }  Sample output:
Handles NPM(K) PM(K) WS(K) CPU(s) Id SI ProcessName ------- ------ ----- ----- ------ -- -- ----------- 4269 188 382940 424100 1,336.</description>

      <description>Getting Comfortable One of the first complaints you may have against PowerShell is how much typing you have to do if you&amp;rsquo;re going to use it interactively.
Take the cmdlet used to output IP addresses on a Windows 10 system:
Get-NetIPAddress  That&amp;rsquo;s 16 characters long, as compared with the 7 character ipconfig we all know and love. It&amp;rsquo;s even longer if you want to make the output readable in the shell:</description>

      <title>Interactive PowerShell, Part 1: The Hidden Shell</title>

      <description>A Shell? What&amp;rsquo;s That? Most of us that know PowerShell know it as an automation tool &amp;mdash; as a way to get remote systems to do things in repeatable ways.
But for as many of us that know the scripting-side of PowerShell, I venture that far fewer know and use PowerShell as an interactive shell. Sure, we may occasionally use it as Command Prompt replacement, but are we truly harnessing the full capacity of PowerShell as a shell?</description>
