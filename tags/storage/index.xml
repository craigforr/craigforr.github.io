      <description>Important
As always, this post is provided &amp;ldquo;as-is&amp;rdquo; without any warranty of any kind, and contains operations which can irrevocably destroy data on your systems. Your systems, storage, and other devices may have configurations or edge cases I have not accounted for here. Take great care and test these commands and any resulting scripts you create in lab/test/development environments to avoid catastrophic data loss.
It is a good idea to perform a full data backup or take a snapshot prior to performing potentially destructive operations.</description>
